2019.01.25  Added category 7-exercise and file-thingies.. 
2019.01.24  Added HashMap, more ArrayUtils and some corrections.
2019.01.14  Added arrays exercises and tweaked some files.
2019.01.13  Finished Last exercise but not really impressed on my code, feels chunky and ugly (Either need to clean up or make more class to keep up "my standard")
2019.01.13  Most of stage1-exercises are done and "so-called" a proper class with validators. Tho still not happy with validators.
2019.01.12  Still a struggle with validators, need to postpone the idea and finish rest of thingies.
2019.01.12  A bit struggle with validators, since the language is a bit different and some of callings doesn't work as planned
2019.01.12  A new exercise and a couple ideas how to make them.
2019.01.11  Punch of new exercises, harj2-class and some additional thingies. Tomorrow add rest of harj1-files.
2019.01.08  Changes for template and comment fields
2019.01.07  A bit more commit and changes for preliminary files
2019.01.07  Git repo for learning of Java, Start of 15DAPT232.01 course at Tredu
